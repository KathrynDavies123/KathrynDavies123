# Hi, I'm Kathryn!

I'm a frontend developer with experience in Angular, React, Typescript and Sass. I have experience working in an Agile team using Scrum methodology and have collaborated with designers, backend developers and product owners to achieve project goals. 

I'm looking for a frontend developer position to continue my career in an environment where I can contribute meaningfully, learn and grow personally and professionally.
